/**
 * Agent-prompt adapter for the Cliq channel.
 *
 * Surfaces Cliq-specific guidance to the agent's system prompt so the model
 * writes output that converts cleanly to Cliq's native formatting and knows
 * which message-tool actions / targeting / reactions are available. This is
 * the SDK's `ChannelAgentPromptAdapter` surface (forwarded by
 * `createChatChannelPlugin` from `base`), consumed by the runtime's system
 * prompt assembly:
 *
 * - `messageToolHints` → appended as bullet lines under the shared `message`
 *   tool section (the cross-channel `action=send` / `action=edit` / … tool).
 * - `messageToolCapabilities` → capability strings gating prompt blocks.
 *   Cliq does NOT advertise `inlineButtons` (no Cliq button-sending support
 *   yet) nor `richText` (a Telegram-specific Bot-API rich-text term); we
 *   return an empty list so no misleading prompt block is emitted.
 * - `inboundFormattingHints` → `response_format` object in the trusted
 *   inbound-metadata block, telling the model what markup inbound uses and
 *   what markup to emit for reply.
 * - `reactionGuidance` → `## Reactions` system-prompt section. Cliq supports
 *   outbound reactions (the `react` message-action), so we advertise
 *   `"minimal"` by default; operators can opt into `"extensive"` or `"off"`
 *   via `channels.cliq.reactions.agentGuidance`.
